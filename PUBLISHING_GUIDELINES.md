Publishing guidelines — Engage & Inspire (condensed)

These guidelines summarize best practices for publishing on Ready Tensor, adapted from the "Engage and Inspire" guidance.

1. Lead with a clear hook
- Start with a concise TL;DR (1–2 sentences) that tells readers what the project does and why it matters.

2. Audience-first framing
- State the target audience and what problems the project solves for them.

3. Make examples immediate
- Provide a short, runnable example near the top (quickstart) so readers can try the project in minutes.

4. Tell a clear narrative
- Explain the problem, constraints, approach, and trade-offs. Use headings for Problem, Approach, Results, and Limitations.

5. Show outcomes and metrics
- If applicable, share evaluation metrics, sample queries, and examples of correct vs. incorrect outputs.

6. Keep docs concise and scannable
- Use short paragraphs, bullets, and code blocks. Link to more detailed docs for advanced topics.

7. Provide reproducible steps
- Include exact commands for environment setup, installation, and a minimal reproducible demo.

8. Accessibility & tone
- Write in active voice, avoid jargon where possible, and add alt text for images.

9. License, citation, and contribution
- Include license info, a citation file (`CITATION.cff`), and a short contributing checklist.

10. Publishing checklist
- TL;DR present
- Quickstart example works
- Target audience stated
- CITATION.cff updated
- README front matter cleaned and readable

For Ready Tensor, prefer short, engaging posts that focus on what readers can do with the project and why it matters. If you want, I can create a short release-ready README front-matter and a Quickstart snippet next.
